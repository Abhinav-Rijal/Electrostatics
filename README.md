# Electrostatics
Coulomb's law, electrostatic force, intensity, potential of point charges and their different plots with distance; using OOP and pandas.
Also, for a given force magnitude between two protons, finds the required distance between them and plots the equipotential curve in 2-D for that force magnitude.

Newton's law, gravitational force, intensity, potential of point masses and their different plots with distance; using OOP.

Calculation and comparision of electrostatic and gravitational forces between an electron and a proton in a H-atom.

Plot for comparision of electrostatic and gravitational forces between an electron and a proton for a range of distances.
